## Welcome to my FoldingText plug-ins

[FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com) is a [Markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) editor with some outstanding and unique features from _Hog Bay Software_.

It has an easy to use plug-in interface to extend its functionality via Java Script.
So, I made some plugins for my own use.
If you are interested, you can [download them from here](comingsoon.zip) and [drop them into FoldingText](http://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/how-to-install-a-plugin/74) `plugins` folder.

### CaseFlipper

CaseFlipper is a plugin which installs a new keyboard shortcut `cmd-ctrl-K` to change the first letter of the last typed word
from lower case to upper case or vice versa.
