## Welcome to my FoldingText plug-ins

[FoldingText] is a [Markdown] editor with some outstanding and unique features
from _Hog Bay Software_.

It has an easy to use plug-in interface to extend its functionality via Java Script.
So, I made some plugins for my own use. If you are interested, you can [download]
them and [drop them into the `foldingtext-plugins` folder][install].

### CaseFlipper

CaseFlipper is a plugin which installs a new keyboard shortcut `cmd-ctrl-K`
to change the first letter of the last typed word from lower case to
upper case or vice versa.
